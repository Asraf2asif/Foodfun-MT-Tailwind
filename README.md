# Foodfun-MT-Tailwind
An approach to creating a beautiful home page for my Laravel restaurant site project. It's a Tailwind-styled page and also PostCSS plugin used for maximum browser compatibility. Its clean, responsible, and material design will be further improved and some new components will be added in a future version.
